                                <p>Couched between two hills in the mist-clad Western Ghats, the Tea County has
                                    something to state every taste. Go on a tea plantation tour, trek up the Munnar
                                    hills, paraglide over the valleys, bicycle down rocky trails, catch a glimpse of
                                    exotic birds... the possibilities are endless. If youre not an outdoor guy, fret
                                    not. Sip a cup of freshly brewed tea with your special one and watch the mist
                                    settle.</p>



                                <p>A cozy and convenient space for events & conferences. </p>



                                <p>Cosily nestled right in the middle of two hills is Tea County, your official host in
                                    Munnar. Here, every room offers mesmerizing views. You can enjoy the mist rolling
                                    down in the warmth of luxuriously furnished rooms. And it is literally a
                                    honeymooners paradise. Those who want to venture out may bicycle down mountain
                                    trails, paraglide over the valleys, go trekking, climb rocks, try to catch a rainbow
                                    trout or spend a day in a tea plantation. This is also an important location for
                                    ecotourism activities especially centered around Eravikulam National Park, Chinnar
                                    Wildlife Sanctuary and shola forests like Pampadum Shola National Park and the newly
                                    created Neelakurinji Sanctuary. There are opportunities to sight wild animals
                                    especially Nilgiri tahr (mountain goat), elephant, bison etc.</p>


                                <p> This beautiful destination is having a beautiful blend of rustic and royal charm.
