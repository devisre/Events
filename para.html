    <h1>My Paragraph</h1>

    <p id="Family">A Set is a Collection that cannot contain duplicate elements. It models the mathematical set abstraction. 
        The Set interface contains only methods inherited from Collection and adds the restriction that duplicate elements 
        are prohibited.</p>

    <p id="Style">There are three main implementations of Set interface: HashSet, TreeSet, and LinkedHashSet. HashSet, which 
        stores its elements in a hash table, is the best-performing implementation; however it makes no guarantees 
        concerning the order of iteration. TreeSet, which stores its elements in a red-black tree, orders its elements 
        based on their values; it is substantially slower than HashSet. LinkedHashSet, which is implemented as a hash 
        table with a linked list running through it, orders its elements based on the order in which they were inserted 
        into the set insertion-order.</p>
        
     <p id="Variant"> Java HashSet The set interface is present in java.util package and extends the	
        Collection interface is an unordered collection of objects in which	
        duplicate	 values	 cannot	 be	 stored.	 It	 is	 an	 interface	 that	
        implements	 the	 mathematical	 set.	 This	 interface	 contains	 the	
        methods	inherited	from	the	Collection	interface	and	adds	a	feature	
        that	restricts	the	insertion	of	the	duplicate	elements.	</p>

    <p id="Trans"><a id="A" href="new.html">Multithreading </a> in Java is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.
            A thread is a lightweight sub-process, the smallest unit of processing. Multiprocessing and 
            multithreading, both are used to achieve multitasking.
            However, we use multithreading than multiprocessing because threads use a shared memory 
            area. They don't allocate separate memory area so saves memory, and context-switching 
            between the threads takes less time than process </p>

    <p><a href="Form.html">Garbage Collection </a>in Java is a process by which the programs perform memory management automatically. The 
            Garbage Collector(GC) finds the unused objects and deletes them to reclaim the memoryGarbage Collection 
            Garbage collection in Java happens automatically during the lifetime of the program, eliminating the need 
            to de-allocate memory and thereby avoiding memory leaks.Advantage of Garbage CollectionIt makes java memory
            efficient because garbage collector removes the unreferenced objects from heap memory.
            It is automatically done by the garbage collector(a part of JVM) so we don't need to make 
            extra efforts.How can an object be unreferenced.</p>
