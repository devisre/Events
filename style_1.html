<p class="p1">The deer said, “I can chase them away for sure. But you see, I am very busy at the moment. So, unfortunately, I will not be able to help you. Why don’t you go and ask the bear for help?” The rabbit was disappointed to see that the deer wouldn’t help him out. But still, he had to save his own life so he went to the bear and asked for his help. He was certain that the bear was his true friend and he would definitely help. But no such thing happened. The bear said, “I would have helped you out, dear rabbit. But I am very tired and I need some food. Why don’t you go and ask your monkey friend for help?”. The rabbit was disappointed once again. But still, he went to the monkey. But the monkey didn’t help him either.


One by one, he went to the elephant, the goat, and the other animals for help. But no one was ready to help him. He was very sad that none of his friends were there for him. But then he realized that he had to save himself and for that, he had to find a solution on his own.


The Rabbit Saves Himself
With that realization, the rabbit made a plan to get away from the wild dogs. He went and hid under a bush. He lay completely still there and didn’t make any noise. The wild dogs couldn’t find him anywhere and soon left the forest. This way, the rabbit was able to save his life. In all this trouble, the rabbit understood that he was better off relying on himself than on others.
