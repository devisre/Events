<p class="p1">Once upon a time, there lived a cute, white bunny rabbit in a forest. The rabbit had a lot of friends and he was very proud of the friendship that he had formed with the animals. He always thought that if he came face to face with any problem, his friends would always be there to help him out. This is why he was good to everyone and helped others whenever he could. But one day everything changed in the life of the bunny rabbit.


The Rabbit is in Danger 
One day, when the rabbit was roaming in the forest, he heard the sound of wild dogs. The bunny got really scared as he had to save himself. If the dogs found where he was, they would eat him up. So, the bunny rabbit rushed to his friends for help. First, he went to his very good friend, the deer. The rabbit said. “My friend, I am in big trouble. There are some wild dogs in the forest and they will kill me if they find out where I am. You have such big antlers. Please chase them away so that they don’t find me.”
