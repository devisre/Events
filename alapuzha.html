                                <p>A picturesque 1.5 hour journey away from Kochi lies Seclude Marari Sands. This lush
                                    green resort has 13 rooms with wide windows and a classic front porch for a
                                    wonderful view of the flourishing outdoors. There are 9 private one-bedroom villas,
                                    each designed around a unique element of Kerala to add a splash of vibrance to your
                                    stay. Four aesthetic rooms face a clear pool which reflects the bright blue skies.</p>

                                <p>Meandering stone paths will lead you to an open-air dining where you can relish
                                    authentic Kerala cuisine to the music of the waves. It is an experience like no
                                    other when you sit on what was once a fishing boat, now a majestic dining table. A
                                    few steps beyond that, a sandy beach beckons.</p>
                                <p>On the outskirts of Allepey, Marari is an oasis of tranquillity for all those who
                                    wish to take a break from the hustle bustle of city life.

                                </p>
                                <p>Seclude Kerala Marari Sands is a property with access to the beach. Most of the
                                    events that take place here have all been outdoor or on the beach.</p>

                                <p> This beautiful destination is having a beautiful blend of rustic and royal charm.
